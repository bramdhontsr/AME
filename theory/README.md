# Theory  
### Contextual Pathways of The Praxis of Everything

---

## 1. Empirical Realism vs. Epistemological Idealism  
- **Kant**: combined *transcendental idealism* with *empirical realism*.  
- After Kant, the positions diverged:  
  - **Empirical Realism** → positivism, data-driven science, AI.  
  - **Epistemological Idealism** → German Idealism (Fichte, Hegel), phenomenology (Husserl), constructivism.  
- Today: AI embodies empirical realism (*data as world*), philosophy stresses idealism (*no data without interpretation*).

## 2. Cosmological Horizons  
- **Heat Death (ΛCDM):** universe expands, entropy maximizes, free energy vanishes.  
- **Penrose’s CCC (Conformal Cyclic Cosmology):** aeons succeed each other; end and beginning coincide conformally.  
- **Tension:** linear exhaustion vs. cyclical renewal.

## 3. Conservative Recursion (A003558)  
- Sequence A003558 and similar structures show **form as reconfiguration** rather than accumulation.  
- Each step conserves content, only reshuffles.  
- This *conservative backend* is the mathematical analogue of background radiation.  

---

## 4. Fragmentary Change  
- Art intervenes through **motifs, signs, fragments**.  
- Old and new elements enter the recursion, producing fresh horizons.  
- This forms the *progressive frontend*.  

---

## 5. Intermediary Praxis  
- **Raspberry Pi + Display** act as practical hinge.  
- Backend = computation, recursion.  
- Frontend = images, sound, participant input.  
- Intermediary = praxis: where conservation and change meet.  

---

## 6. Multiversal Participation  
- Each participant acts from a unique proposition.  
- Their fragments are fed into the conservative recursion.  
- The result is not accumulation but **redistribution** — a multiversal field of horizons.
