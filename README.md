# The Praxis of Everything  
### Conservative Recursion and Fragmentary Change  

---

### 🌌 Core Idea  
Form is not accumulation but **reconfiguration**.  
In sequences such as **A003558**, each step does not grow by adding something new, but by rearranging what already exists. This is **conservative recursion**.  

Art and praxis feed this process with **fragmentary change**: old and new motifs, intuitive signs, unexpected movements. Together with the primordial background radiation of *Le moment Dansa*, a continuum of cycles emerges in which every participant projects their own universe.

### 🔹 Conservative Backend  
- The backend is cyclic, repetitive, recursive.  
- It preserves logic and memory structures.  
- Like cosmic background radiation: present, latent, carrying.  

### 🔹 Progressive Frontend  
- The frontend is mutable, open, receptive.  
- Here the motifs appear: paintings, sounds, texts, data.  
- Fragments contributed by participants are inserted into the cyclic pattern.  

### 🔹 Intermediary (Raspberry + Display)  
- Between backend and frontend lies the **intermediary**.  
- The Raspberry Pi computes, reconfigures, and renders.  
- The display is not a neutral screen but a **time crystal**: frozen cycles made visible.  

---

### 🔹 Philosophical Stance  
This project rejects the **heat death of ever-expanding logic**.  
Where linear accumulation leads to exhaustion, cyclic reconfiguration constantly brings forth a new horizon.  

- **Backend** = conservation, memory, preservation.  
- **Frontend** = renewal, fragment, creation.  
- **Intermediary** = praxis, the link between both.  

Thus arises an **artificial cosmology** that does not build up but continuously **redistributes** itself.

### 🤝 Invitation  
Every participant acts from a different proposition.  
This project invites you to add your fragments into the cyclic backend and to witness how a **multiversal reality** emerges — not accumulative, but reconfigurative.

👉 *The Praxis of Everything is not a system that aims to possess, but a field where action and horizon continuously meet anew.*
