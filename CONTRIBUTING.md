# Contributing to AME (ArtMindEco / The Praxis of Everything)

## Philosophy-first
Form is not accumulation but reconfiguration. Contributions should respect the conservative–recursive backend and the fragmentary, progressive frontend.

## How to contribute
1. Open an Issue describing the proposal (theory, algorithm, experiment).
2. Link to a minimal proof (code snippet, figure, or short note).
3. Submit a Pull Request referencing the Issue.

## Structure
- /theory — notes, references, essays
- /algorithms — minimal, well-documented scripts (prefer pure functions)
- /experiments — prototypes, visual tests, notebooks or demos
- /contributions — community materials

## Coding guidelines
- Keep it minimal and composable (small pure functions).
- Prefer explicit data-flow over hidden state.
- Include a short README in each experiment when non-trivial.
- Add a quick-start section: how to run in 3 lines.

## Tests (lightweight)
- For algorithms, include a small self-test (no heavy frameworks required).
